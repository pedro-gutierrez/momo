# Overview

**Sleeky** is a web development framework written in Elixir designed with productivity in mind.

Being based on the same "Entity your context, derive the rest" philosophy from Ash, applications written with Sleeky are
declarative. Developers can spend more time focusing on their context, while leaving all the tedious boilerplate to Sleeky.
