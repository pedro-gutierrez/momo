# Installation

Let's get a Momo application up and running as quickly as possible.

You will need at least Elixir 1.14 and Erlang 25.

## Getting the installer

Momo comes with a project generator:

```console
$ mix archive.install hex momo_new
```

## Creating a new project

Use the `momo.new` task and generate your new app:

```console
$ mix momo.new hello
```
